	// the input log into EventData structs yields a sixfold improvement in run
	// time and CPU cost in testing against a 45-MiB log of reference event
	// data. When removing the actual rendering of graph data in a test run with
	// each log-file reading implementation, the measured performance gain is
	// 42-fold. The difference is 80-fold if we also remove the encoding of the
	// blank image canvas to a png file. Which should help to illustrate the
	// absurd cost of avoiding an "unsafe" method for reading a file which would
	// be considered perfectly valid in traditional systems development.
